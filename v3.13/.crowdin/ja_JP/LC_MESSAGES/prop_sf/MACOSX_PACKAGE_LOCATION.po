msgid "Place a source file inside a Application Bundle (:prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE`), Core Foundation Bundle (:prop_tgt:`BUNDLE`), or Framework Bundle (:prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK`).  It is applicable for macOS and iOS."

msgid "Executable targets with the :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE` property set are built as macOS or iOS application bundles on Apple platforms.  Shared library targets with the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` property set are built as macOS or iOS frameworks on Apple platforms.  Module library targets with the :prop_tgt:`BUNDLE` property set are built as macOS ``CFBundle`` bundles on Apple platforms.  Source files listed in the target with this property set will be copied to a directory inside the bundle or framework content folder specified by the property value.  For macOS Application Bundles the content folder is ``<name>.app/Contents``.  For macOS Frameworks the content folder is ``<name>.framework/Versions/<version>``.  For macOS CFBundles the content folder is ``<name>.bundle/Contents`` (unless the extension is changed).  See the :prop_tgt:`PUBLIC_HEADER`, :prop_tgt:`PRIVATE_HEADER`, and :prop_tgt:`RESOURCE` target properties for specifying files meant for ``Headers``, ``PrivateHeaders``, or ``Resources`` directories."

msgid "If the specified location is equal to ``Resources``, the resulting location will be the same as if the :prop_tgt:`RESOURCE` property had been used. If the specified location is a sub-folder of ``Resources``, it will be placed into the respective sub-folder. Note: For iOS Apple uses a flat bundle layout where no ``Resources`` folder exist. Therefore CMake strips the ``Resources`` folder name from the specified location."
