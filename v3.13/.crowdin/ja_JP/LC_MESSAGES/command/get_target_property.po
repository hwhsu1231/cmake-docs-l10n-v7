msgid "Get a property from a target.  The value of the property is stored in the variable ``VAR``.  If the target property is not found, the behavior depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property or not (see :command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will set ``VAR`` to \"NOTFOUND\", whereas inherited properties will search the relevant parent scope as described for the :command:`define_property` command and if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to an empty string."

msgid "Use :command:`set_target_properties` to set target property values. Properties are usually used to control how a target is built, but some query the target instead.  This command can get properties for any target so far created.  The targets do not need to be in the current ``CMakeLists.txt`` file."
