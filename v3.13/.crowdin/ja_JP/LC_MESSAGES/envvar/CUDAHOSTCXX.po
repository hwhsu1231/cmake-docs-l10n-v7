msgid "Preferred executable for compiling host code when compiling ``CUDA`` language files. Will only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``CUDA`` host compiler, after which the value for ``CUDAHOSTCXX`` is stored in the cache as :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER`. For any configuration run (including the first), the environment variable will be ignored if the :variable:`CMAKE_CUDA_HOST_COMPILER` variable is defined."

msgid "This environment variable is primarily meant for use with projects that enable ``CUDA`` as a first-class language.  The :module:`FindCUDA` module will also use it to initialize its ``CUDA_HOST_COMPILER`` setting."
