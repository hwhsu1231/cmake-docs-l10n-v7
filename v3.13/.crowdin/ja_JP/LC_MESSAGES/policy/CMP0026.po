msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed reading the LOCATION target property (and configuration-specific variants) to determine the eventual location of build targets.  This relies on the assumption that all necessary information is available at configure-time to determine the final location and filename of the target.  However, this property is not fully determined until later at generate-time.  At generate time, the $<TARGET_FILE> generator expression can be used to determine the eventual LOCATION of a target output."

msgid "Code which reads the LOCATION target property can be ported to use the $<TARGET_FILE> generator expression together with the file(GENERATE) subcommand to generate a file containing the target location."
