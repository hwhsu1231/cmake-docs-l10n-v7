msgid "Some CMake generators support selection of an instance of the native build system when multiple instances are available.  If the user specifies an instance (e.g. by setting this cache entry), or after a default instance is chosen when a build tree is first configured, the value will be available in this variable."

msgid "The value of this variable should never be modified by project code. A toolchain file specified by the :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` variable may initialize ``CMAKE_GENERATOR_INSTANCE`` as a cache entry. Once a given build tree has been initialized with a particular value for this variable, changing the value has undefined behavior."
