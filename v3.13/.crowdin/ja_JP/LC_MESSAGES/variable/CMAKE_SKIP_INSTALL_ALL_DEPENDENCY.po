msgid "By default, the ``install`` target depends on the ``all`` target.  This has the effect, that when ``make install`` is invoked or ``INSTALL`` is built, first the ``all`` target is built, then the installation starts. If :variable:`CMAKE_SKIP_INSTALL_ALL_DEPENDENCY` is set to ``TRUE``, this dependency is not created, so the installation process will start immediately, independent from whether the project has been completely built or not."
