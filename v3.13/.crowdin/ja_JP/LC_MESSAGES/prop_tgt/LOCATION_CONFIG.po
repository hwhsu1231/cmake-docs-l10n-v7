msgid "A read-only property that indicates where a target's main file is located on disk for the configuration <CONFIG>.  The property is defined only for library and executable targets.  An imported target may provide a set of configurations different from that of the importing project.  By default CMake looks for an exact-match but otherwise uses an arbitrary available configuration.  Use the MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG> property to map imported configurations explicitly."

msgid "Do not set properties that affect the location of a target after reading this property.  These include properties whose names match \"(RUNTIME|LIBRARY|ARCHIVE)_OUTPUT_(NAME|DIRECTORY)(_<CONFIG>)?\", ``(IMPLIB_)?(PREFIX|SUFFIX)``, or \"LINKER_LANGUAGE\".  Failure to follow this rule is not diagnosed and leaves the location of the target undefined."
