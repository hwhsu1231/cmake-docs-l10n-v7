msgid "When this property is set to ``TRUE`` the executable when built on macOS or iOS will be created as an application bundle.  This makes it a GUI executable that can be launched from the Finder.  See the :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_BUNDLE_INFO_PLIST` target property for information about creation of the ``Info.plist`` file for the application bundle. This property is initialized by the value of the variable :variable:`CMAKE_MACOSX_BUNDLE` if it is set when a target is created."
