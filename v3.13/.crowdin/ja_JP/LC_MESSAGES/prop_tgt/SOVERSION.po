msgid "For shared libraries :prop_tgt:`VERSION` and ``SOVERSION`` can be used to specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number. ``SOVERSION`` is ignored if :prop_tgt:`NO_SONAME` property is set."

See the :prop_tgt:`FRAMEWORK` target property for an example.  Versions of Mach-O binaries may be checked with the ``otool -L <binary>`` command."
