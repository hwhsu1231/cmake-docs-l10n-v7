msgid "Compilers typically pass directories containing language runtime libraries and default library search paths when they invoke a linker. These paths are implicit linker search directories for the compiler's language.  CMake automatically detects these directories for each language and reports the results in this variable."

msgid "Some toolchains read implicit directories from an environment variable such as ``LIBRARY_PATH``.  If using such an environment variable, keep its value consistent when operating in a given build tree because CMake saves the value detected when first creating a build tree."

msgid "If policy :policy:`CMP0060` is not set to ``NEW``, then when a library in one of these directories is given by full path to :command:`target_link_libraries` CMake will generate the ``-l<name>`` form on link lines for historical purposes."
