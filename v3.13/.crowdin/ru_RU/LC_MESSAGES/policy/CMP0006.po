msgid "Installing MACOSX_BUNDLE targets requires a BUNDLE DESTINATION."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0006.rst:6
msgid "This policy determines whether the install(TARGETS) command must be given a BUNDLE DESTINATION when asked to install a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set.  CMake 2.4 and below did not distinguish application bundles from normal executables when installing targets. CMake 2.6 provides a BUNDLE option to the install(TARGETS) command that specifies rules specific to application bundles on the Mac. Projects should use this option when installing a target with the MACOSX_BUNDLE property set."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0006.rst:15
msgid "The OLD behavior for this policy is to fall back to the RUNTIME DESTINATION if a BUNDLE DESTINATION is not given.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to produce an error if a bundle target is installed without a BUNDLE DESTINATION."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0006.rst:20
msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version 2.6.0.  CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
