msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a signature for :command:`add_custom_command` which specified an input to a command.  This was undocumented behavior. Modern use of CMake associates custom commands with their output, rather than their input."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0050.rst:11
msgid "The OLD behavior for this policy is to allow the use of :command:`add_custom_command` SOURCE signatures.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to issue an error if such a signature is used."

msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0. CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
