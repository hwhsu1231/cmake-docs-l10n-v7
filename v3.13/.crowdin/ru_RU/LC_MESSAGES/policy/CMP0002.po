msgid "The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the OUTPUT_NAME target property to create two targets with the same physical name while keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets must simply have globally unique names (unless one uses the global property ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS with a Makefiles generator)."
