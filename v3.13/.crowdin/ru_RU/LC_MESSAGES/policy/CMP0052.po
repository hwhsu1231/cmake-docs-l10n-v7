msgid "CMake 3.0 and lower allowed subdirectories of the source directory or build directory to be in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of installed and exported targets, if the directory was also a subdirectory of the installation prefix.  This makes the installation depend on the existence of the source dir or binary dir, and the installation will be broken if either are removed after installation."
