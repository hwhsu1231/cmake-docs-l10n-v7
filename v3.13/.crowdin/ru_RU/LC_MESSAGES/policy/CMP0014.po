msgid "CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing CMakeLists.txt files in directories referenced by add_subdirectory() or subdirs(), treating them as if present but empty.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this policy determines whether or not the case is an error.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to silently ignore the problem.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to report an error."
