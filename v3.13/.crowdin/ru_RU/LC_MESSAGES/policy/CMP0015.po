msgid "In CMake 2.8.0 and lower the link_directories() command passed relative paths unchanged to the linker.  In CMake 2.8.1 and above the link_directories() command prefers to interpret relative paths with respect to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR, which is consistent with include_directories() and other commands.  The OLD behavior for this policy is to use relative paths verbatim in the linker command.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to convert relative paths to absolute paths by appending the relative path to CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR."
