msgid "Load in the values from another cache and store them in the local project's cache as internal entries.  This is useful for a project that depends on another project built in a different tree.  ``EXCLUDE`` option can be used to provide a list of entries to be excluded. ``INCLUDE_INTERNALS`` can be used to provide a list of internal entries to be included.  Normally, no internal entries are brought in.  Use of this form of the command is strongly discouraged, but it is provided for backward compatibility."
