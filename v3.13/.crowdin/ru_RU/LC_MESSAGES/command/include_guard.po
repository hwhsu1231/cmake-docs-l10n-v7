msgid "CMake will end its processing of the current file at the location of the :command:`include_guard` command if the current file has already been processed for the applicable scope (see below). This provides functionality similar to the include guards commonly used in source headers or to the ``#pragma once`` directive. If the current file has been processed previously for the applicable scope, the effect is as though :command:`return` had been called. Do not call this command from inside a function being defined within the current file."
