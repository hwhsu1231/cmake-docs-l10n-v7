msgid "Removes a normal variable from the current scope, causing it to become undefined.  If ``CACHE`` is present, then a cache variable is removed instead of a normal variable.  Note that when evaluating :ref:`Variable References` of the form ``${VAR}``, CMake first searches for a normal variable with that name.  If no such normal variable exists, CMake will then search for a cache entry with that name.  Because of this unsetting a normal variable can expose a cache variable that was previously hidden.  To force a variable reference of the form ``${VAR}`` to return an empty string, use ``set(<variable> \"\")``, which clears the normal variable but leaves it defined."
