msgid "This module defines three macros: CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE() and CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE() These macros can be used to save, restore and reset (i.e., clear contents) the state of the variables CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS, CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS, CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES, CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES and CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES used by the various Check-files coming with CMake, like e.g. check_function_exists() etc.  The variable contents are pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is supported.  This is useful e.g.  when executing such tests in a Find-module, where they have to be set, but after the Find-module has been executed they should have the same value as they had before."

msgid "CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() macro receives optional argument RESET. Whether it's specified, CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE() will set all CMAKE_REQUIRED_* variables to empty values, same as CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE() call will do."
