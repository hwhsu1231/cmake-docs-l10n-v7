msgid "Enable this boolean property to automatically create a module definition (``.def``) file with all global symbols found in the input ``.obj`` files for a ``SHARED`` library (or executable with :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS`) on Windows.  The module definition file will be passed to the linker causing all symbols to be exported from the ``.dll``. For global *data* symbols, ``__declspec(dllimport)`` must still be used when compiling against the code in the ``.dll``.  All other function symbols will be automatically exported and imported by callers.  This simplifies porting projects to Windows by reducing the need for explicit ``dllexport`` markup, even in ``C++`` classes."

msgid "When this property is enabled, zero or more ``.def`` files may also be specified as source files of the target.  The exports named by these files will be merged with those detected from the object files to generate a single module definition file to be passed to the linker.  This can be used to export symbols from a ``.dll`` that are not in any of its object files but are added by the linker from dependencies (e.g. ``msvcrt.lib``)."
