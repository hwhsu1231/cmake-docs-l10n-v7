msgid "This property specifies the list of directories given so far to the :command:`target_include_directories` command.  In addition to accepting values from that command, values may be set directly on any target using the :command:`set_property` command.  A target gets its initial value for this property from the value of the :prop_dir:`INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` directory property.  Both directory and target property values are adjusted by calls to the :command:`include_directories` command."
