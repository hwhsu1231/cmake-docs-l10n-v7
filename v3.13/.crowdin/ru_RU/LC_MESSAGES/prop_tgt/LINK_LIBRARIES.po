msgid "A call to :command:`target_link_libraries(<target> ...)` may update this property on ``<target>``.  If ``<target>`` was not created in the same directory as the call then :command:`target_link_libraries` will add a suffix of the form ``::@<directory-id>`` to each entry, where the ``::@`` is a separator and the ``<directory-id>`` is unspecified. This tells the generators that the named libraries must be looked up in the scope of the caller rather than in the scope in which the ``<target>`` was created.  Valid directory ids are stripped on export by the :command:`install(EXPORT)` and :command:`export` commands."
