For bundles on macOS this is the location of the executable file inside Contents/MacOS under the application bundle folder.  For static libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module. For shared libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared library.  For frameworks on macOS this is the location of the library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this is the location of the \".dll\" part of the library.  For UNKNOWN libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for non-imported targets."
