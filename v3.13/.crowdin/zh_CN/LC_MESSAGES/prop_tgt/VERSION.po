msgid "For shared libraries ``VERSION`` and :prop_tgt:`SOVERSION` can be used to specify the build version and API version respectively.  When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks and the linker supports so-names.  If only one of both is specified the missing is assumed to have the same version number.  For executables ``VERSION`` can be used to specify the build version.  When building or installing appropriate symlinks are created if the platform supports symlinks."
