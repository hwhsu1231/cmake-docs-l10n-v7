msgid "If this property is set to ``ON``, then the value of the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` target property is treated as a requirement.  If this property is ``OFF`` or unset, the :prop_tgt:`C_STANDARD` target property is treated as optional and may \"decay\" to a previous standard if the requested is not available.  For compilers that have no notion of a standard level, such as MSVC, this has no effect."
