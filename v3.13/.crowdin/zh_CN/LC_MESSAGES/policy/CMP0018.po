#: ../../../policy/CMP0018.rst:6
msgid "CMake 2.8.8 and lower compiled sources in SHARED and MODULE libraries using the value of the undocumented CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS platform variable.  The variable contained platform-specific flags needed to compile objects for shared libraries.  Typically it included a flag such as -fPIC for position independent code but also included other flags needed on certain platforms.  CMake 2.8.9 and higher prefer instead to use the POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE target property to determine what targets should be position independent, and new undocumented platform variables to select flags while ignoring CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS completely."

msgid "The default for either approach produces identical compilation flags, but if a project modifies CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS from its original value this policy determines which approach to use."
