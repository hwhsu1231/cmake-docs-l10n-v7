msgid "CMake 2.8.11 introduced introduced the concept of INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES, and a check at cmake time that the entries in the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of an IMPORTED target actually exist.  CMake 2.8.11 also introduced generator expression support in the target_link_libraries command.  However, if an imported target is linked as a result of a generator expression evaluation, the entries in the INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES of that target were not checked for existence as they should be."
