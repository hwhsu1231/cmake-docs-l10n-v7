#: ../../../policy/CMP0065.rst:7
msgid "CMake 3.3 and below, for historical reasons, always linked executables on some platforms with flags like ``-rdynamic`` to export symbols from the executables for use by any plugins they may load via ``dlopen``. CMake 3.4 and above prefer to do this only for executables that are explicitly marked with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to always use the additional link flags when linking executables regardless of the value of the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property."

msgid "The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to only use the additional link flags when linking executables if the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property is set to ``True``."

msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.4.  Unlike most policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy is not set and simply uses OLD behavior.  See documentation of the :variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0065 <CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>` variable to control the warning."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
