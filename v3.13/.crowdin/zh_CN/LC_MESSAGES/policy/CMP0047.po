#: ../../../policy/CMP0047.rst:6
msgid "CMake 3.0 and above recognize that the QNX qcc compiler driver is different from the GNU compiler. CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``QCC`` instead of ``GNU``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for QNX qcc is just ``GNU`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0. Therefore this policy determines for QNX qcc which compiler id to report in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  The policy must be set prior to the invocation of either command."

msgid "The OLD behavior for this policy is to use the ``GNU`` compiler id for the qcc and QCC compiler drivers. The NEW behavior for this policy is to use the ``QCC`` compiler id for those drivers."

msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  Use the :command:`cmake_policy` command to set this policy to OLD or NEW explicitly. Unlike most policies, CMake version |release| does *not* warn by default when this policy is not set and simply uses OLD behavior. See documentation of the :variable:`CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP0047 <CMAKE_POLICY_WARNING_CMP<NNNN>>` variable to control the warning."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
