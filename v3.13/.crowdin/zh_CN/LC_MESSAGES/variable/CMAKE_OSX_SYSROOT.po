msgid "Specify the location or name of the macOS platform SDK to be used. CMake uses this value to compute the value of the ``-isysroot`` flag or equivalent and to help the ``find_*`` commands locate files in the SDK."

#: ../../../variable/CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT.rst:9
msgid "If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the ``SDKROOT`` environment variable, if set, and otherwise computed based on the :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` or the host platform."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../variable/CMAKE_OSX_VARIABLE.txt:1
msgid "The value of this variable should be set prior to the first :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command invocation because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags. It is intended to be set locally by the user creating a build tree. This variable should be set as a ``CACHE`` entry (or else CMake may remove it while initializing a cache entry of the same name)."
