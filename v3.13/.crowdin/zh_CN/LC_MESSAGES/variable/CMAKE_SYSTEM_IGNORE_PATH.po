msgid ":ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of directories to be *ignored* by the :command:`find_program`, :command:`find_library`, :command:`find_file`, and :command:`find_path` commands.  This is useful in cross-compiling environments where some system directories contain incompatible but possibly linkable libraries.  For example, on cross-compiled cluster environments, this allows a user to ignore directories containing libraries meant for the front-end machine."
