msgid "This command has been superceded by the :command:`install` command.  It is provided for compatibility with older CMake code.  The ``FILES`` form is directly replaced by the ``FILES`` form of the :command:`install` command.  The regexp form can be expressed more clearly using the ``GLOB`` form of the :command:`file` command."

Only files existing in the current source tree or its corresponding location in the binary tree may be listed.  If a file specified already has an extension, that extension will be removed first.  This is useful for providing lists of source files such as foo.cxx when you want the corresponding foo.h to be installed. A typical extension is '.h'."
