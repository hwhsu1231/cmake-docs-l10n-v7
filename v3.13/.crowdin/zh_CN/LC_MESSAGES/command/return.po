msgid "Returns from a file, directory or function.  When this command is encountered in an included file (via :command:`include` or :command:`find_package`), it causes processing of the current file to stop and control is returned to the including file.  If it is encountered in a file which is not included by another file, e.g.  a ``CMakeLists.txt``, control is returned to the parent directory if there is one.  If return is called in a function, control is returned to the caller of the function. Note that a macro is not a function and does not handle return like a function does."
