msgid "Preferred executable for compiling ``CXX`` language files. Will only be used by CMake on the first configuration to determine ``CXX`` compiler, after which the value for ``CXX`` is stored in the cache as :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>`. For any configuration run (including the first), the environment variable will be ignored if the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER <CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER>` variable is defined."
