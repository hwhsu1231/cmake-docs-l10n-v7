msgid "This read-only directory property contains a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of buildsystem targets added in the directory by calls to the :command:`add_library`, :command:`add_executable`, and :command:`add_custom_target` commands.  The list does not include any :ref:`Imported Targets` or :ref:`Alias Targets`, but does include :ref:`Interface Libraries`.  Each entry in the list is the logical name of a target, suitable to pass to the :command:`get_property` command ``TARGET`` option."
