msgid "This macro takes a library base name as an argument, and will choose good values for basename_LIBRARY, basename_LIBRARIES, basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE depending on what has been found and set.  If only basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE is defined, basename_LIBRARY will be set to the release value, and basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG will be set to basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG-NOTFOUND. If only basename_LIBRARY_DEBUG is defined, then basename_LIBRARY will take the debug value, and basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE will be set to basename_LIBRARY_RELEASE-NOTFOUND."

msgid "If the generator supports configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will be set with debug and optimized flags specifying the library to be used for the given configuration.  If no build type has been set or the generator in use does not support configuration types, then basename_LIBRARY and basename_LIBRARIES will take only the release value, or the debug value if the release one is not set."
