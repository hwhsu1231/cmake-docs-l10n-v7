msgid "This read-only directory property contains a :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of subdirectories processed so far by the :command:`add_subdirectory` or :command:`subdirs` commands.  Each entry is the absolute path to the source directory (containing the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file).  This is suitable to pass to the :command:`get_property` command ``DIRECTORY`` option."

msgid "The :command:`subdirs` command does not process its arguments until after the calling directory is fully processed.  Therefore looking up this property in the current directory will not see them."
