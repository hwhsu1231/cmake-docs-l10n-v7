msgid "The ``COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL`` property may contain a list of properties for this target which must be consistent when evaluated as a boolean with the ``INTERFACE`` variant of the property in all linked dependees.  For example, if a property ``FOO`` appears in the list, then for each dependee, the ``INTERFACE_FOO`` property content in all of its dependencies must be consistent with each other, and with the ``FOO`` property in the depender."

msgid "Consistency in this sense has the meaning that if the property is set, then it must have the same boolean value as all others, and if the property is not set, then it is ignored."
