msgid "Set this property to true to tell CMake generators not to add file-level dependencies on the shared library files linked by this target.  Modification to the shared libraries will not be sufficient to re-link this target.  Logical target-level dependencies will not be affected so the linked shared libraries will still be brought up to date before this target is built."
