If ``CLEAR`` is the first argument advanced variables are changed back to unadvanced.  If ``FORCE`` is the first argument, then the variable is made advanced.  If neither ``FORCE`` nor ``CLEAR`` is specified, new values will be marked as advanced, but if the variable already has an advanced/non-advanced state, it will not be changed."
