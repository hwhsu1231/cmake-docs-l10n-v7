msgid "Get a property from a source file.  The value of the property is stored in the variable ``VAR``.  If the source property is not found, the behavior depends on whether it has been defined to be an ``INHERITED`` property or not (see :command:`define_property`).  Non-inherited properties will set ``VAR`` to \"NOTFOUND\", whereas inherited properties will search the relevant parent scope as described for the :command:`define_property` command and if still unable to find the property, ``VAR`` will be set to an empty string."
