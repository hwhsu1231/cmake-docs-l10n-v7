msgid "Boolean environment variable that affects how :manual:`ctest <ctest(1)>` command output reports overall progress.  When set to 1, TRUE, ON or anything else that evaluates to boolean true, progress is reported by repeatedly updating the same line.  This greatly reduces the overall verbosity, but is only supported when output is sent directly to a terminal.  If the environment variable is not set or has a value that evaluates to false, output is reported normally with each test having its own start and end lines logged to the output."
