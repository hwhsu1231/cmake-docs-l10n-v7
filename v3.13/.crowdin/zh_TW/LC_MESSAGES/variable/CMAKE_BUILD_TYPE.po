msgid "This statically specifies what build type (configuration) will be built in this build tree.  Possible values are empty, ``Debug``, ``Release``, ``RelWithDebInfo``, ``MinSizeRel``, ...  This variable is only meaningful to single-configuration generators (such as :ref:`Makefile Generators` and :generator:`Ninja`) i.e.  those which choose a single configuration when CMake runs to generate a build tree as opposed to multi-configuration generators which offer selection of the build configuration within the generated build environment.  There are many per-config properties and variables (usually following clean ``SOME_VAR_<CONFIG>`` order conventions), such as ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_<CONFIG>``, specified as uppercase: ``CMAKE_C_FLAGS_[DEBUG|RELEASE|RELWITHDEBINFO|MINSIZEREL|...]``.  For example, in a build tree configured to build type ``Debug``, CMake will see to having :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS_DEBUG <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG>` settings get added to the :variable:`CMAKE_C_FLAGS <CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS>` settings.  See also :variable:`CMAKE_CONFIGURATION_TYPES`."
