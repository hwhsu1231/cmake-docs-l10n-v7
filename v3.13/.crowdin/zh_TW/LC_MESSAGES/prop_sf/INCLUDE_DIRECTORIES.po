msgid "Contents of ``INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`` may use \"generator expressions\" with the syntax ``$<...>``.  See the :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` manual for available expressions.  However, :generator:`Xcode` does not support per-config per-source settings, so expressions that depend on the build configuration are not allowed with that generator."
