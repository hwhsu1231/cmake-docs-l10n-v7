msgid "In CMake 3.12 and above the :command:`find_package(<PackageName>)` command now searches prefixes specified by the :variable:`<PackageName>_ROOT` CMake variable and the :envvar:`<PackageName>_ROOT` environment variable. Package roots are maintained as a stack so nested calls to all ``find_*`` commands inside find modules also search the roots as prefixes.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to avoid using ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables for other purposes."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use ``<PackageName>_ROOT`` variables."
