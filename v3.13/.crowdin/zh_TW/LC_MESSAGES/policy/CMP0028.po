msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed the use of targets and files with double colons in target_link_libraries, with some buildsystem generators."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0028.rst:9
msgid "The use of double-colons is a common pattern used to namespace IMPORTED targets and ALIAS targets.  When computing the link dependencies of a target, the name of each dependency could either be a target, or a file on disk. Previously, if a target was not found with a matching name, the name was considered to refer to a file on disk.  This can lead to confusing error messages if there is a typo in what should be a target name."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0028.rst:16
msgid "The OLD behavior for this policy is to search for targets, then files on disk, even if the search term contains double-colons.  The NEW behavior for this policy is to issue a FATAL_ERROR if a link dependency contains double-colons but is not an IMPORTED target or an ALIAS target."

msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version 3.0.  CMake version |release| warns when the policy is not set and uses OLD behavior.  Use the cmake_policy command to set it to OLD or NEW explicitly."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
