"Builds targeting macOS no longer choose any SDK or pass an ``-isysroot`` "
"flag to the compiler by default.  Instead, compilers are expected to choose "
"a default macOS SDK on their own.  In order to use a compiler that does not "
"do this, users must now specify ``-DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=macosx`` when "
"configuring their build."

"On macOS with :ref:`Ninja Generators` and :ref:`Makefile Generators`, when a "
"compiler is found in ``/usr/bin``, it is now used as-is and is no longer "
"mapped to the corresponding compiler inside Xcode.  The mapping was "
"introduced by CMake 3.2 to allow build trees to continue to work with their "
"original compiler even when ``xcode-select`` switches to a different Xcode "
"installation.  However, the compilers inside Xcode cannot be used without "
"explicit ``-isysroot`` flags and are therefore not suitable for passing to "
"arbitrary third-party build systems.  Furthermore, the mapping behavior can "
"override user-specified compiler paths.  Therefore, this behavior has been "
"reverted."
