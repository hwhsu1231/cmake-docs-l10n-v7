"Compatibility with versions of CMake older than 2.8.12 has been removed. "
"Calls to :command:`cmake_minimum_required` or :command:`cmake_policy` that "
"set the policy version to an older value now issue an error. Note that calls "
"to those commands can still support older versions of CMake by using their "
"``VERSION`` arguments' ``<min>...<max>`` syntax. This requires only the "
"``<min>`` version of CMake, but when running a newer version, sets policies "
"up to the ``<max>`` version."
