"The CMake Instrumentation API allows for the collection of timing data, "

"All interactions with the CMake instrumentation API must specify both an API "

"When instrumentation is enabled, CMake sets the :prop_gbl:"
"`RULE_LAUNCH_COMPILE`, :prop_gbl:`RULE_LAUNCH_LINK` and :prop_gbl:"
"`RULE_LAUNCH_CUSTOM` global properties to use the ``ctest --instrument`` "
"launcher. Whenever a command is executed with instrumentation enabled, a `v1 "
"Snippet File`_ is created in the project build tree. If the project has been "

"Hooks are specific intervals, configured as part of the `v1 Query Files`_, "
