"Adds :option:`cmake --project-file` option to specify an alternate filename "
"for CMakeLists files.  This determines the top-level file processed when "
"CMake is configured, and the file processed by :command:`add_subdirectory`. "
"By default, this is ``CMakeLists.txt``. If set to anything else, "
"``CMakeLists.txt`` will be used as a fallback if the given file cannot be "
"found within a project subdirectory. The use of alternate project file names "
"is intended for temporary use by developers during an incremental transition "
"and not for publication of a final product. CMake will always emit a warning "
"when the project file is anything other than ``CMakeLists.txt``."
