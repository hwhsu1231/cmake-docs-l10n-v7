msgid "Specify the minimum version of the target platform (e.g. macOS or iOS) on which the target binaries are to be deployed.  CMake uses this variable value for the ``-mmacosx-version-min`` flag or their respective target platform equivalents.  For older Xcode versions that shipped multiple macOS SDKs this variable also helps to choose the SDK in case :variable:`CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT` is unset."

msgid "If not set explicitly the value is initialized by the ``MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET`` environment variable, if set, and otherwise computed based on the host platform."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../variable/CMAKE_OSX_VARIABLE.txt:1
msgid "The value of this variable should be set prior to the first :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command invocation because it may influence configuration of the toolchain and flags. It is intended to be set locally by the user creating a build tree. This variable should be set as a ``CACHE`` entry (or else CMake may remove it while initializing a cache entry of the same name) unless policy :policy:`CMP0126` is set to ``NEW``."
