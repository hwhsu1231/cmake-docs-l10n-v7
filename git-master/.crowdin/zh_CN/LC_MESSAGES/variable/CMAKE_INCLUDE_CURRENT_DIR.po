msgid "If this variable is enabled, CMake automatically adds :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR` and :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` to the include path for each directory.  These additional include directories do not propagate down to subdirectories.  This is useful mainly for out-of-source builds, where files generated into the build tree are included by files located in the source tree."
