msgid "This module defines three macros: ``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` ``CMAKE_POP_CHECK_STATE()`` and ``CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()`` These macros can be used to save, restore and reset (i.e., clear contents) the state of the variables ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_FLAGS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_DEFINITIONS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_OPTIONS``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LIBRARIES``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_LINK_DIRECTORIES``, ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_INCLUDES`` and ``CMAKE_EXTRA_INCLUDE_FILES`` used by the various Check-files coming with CMake, like e.g. ``check_function_exists()`` etc. The variable contents are pushed on a stack, pushing multiple times is supported.  This is useful e.g.  when executing such tests in a Find-module, where they have to be set, but after the Find-module has been executed they should have the same value as they had before."

msgid "``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` macro receives optional argument ``RESET``. Whether it's specified, ``CMAKE_PUSH_CHECK_STATE()`` will set all ``CMAKE_REQUIRED_*`` variables to empty values, same as ``CMAKE_RESET_CHECK_STATE()`` call will do."
