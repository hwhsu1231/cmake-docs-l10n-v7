msgid "In CMake 2.8.0 and lower the :command:`link_directories` command passed relative paths unchanged to the linker.  In CMake 2.8.1 and above the :command:`link_directories` command prefers to interpret relative paths with respect to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``, which is consistent with :command:`include_directories` and other commands.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to use relative paths verbatim in the linker command.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to convert relative paths to absolute paths by appending the relative path to ``CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR``."
