msgid "In CMake 3.16 and below, the :command:`target_compile_options` command ignores the ``BEFORE`` keyword when inserting items into the :prop_tgt:`COMPILE_OPTIONS` target property (``PRIVATE`` and ``PUBLIC`` items).  CMake 3.17 and later honors the ``BEFORE`` keyword in all cases. This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the new behavior."
