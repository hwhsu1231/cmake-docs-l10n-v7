msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0145.rst:8
msgid "These modules were added very early in CMake's development to support driving tests with a \"DART\" tool, but DART has not been distributed or maintained for many years.  Projects would ``include(Dart)`` to use it, and the ``Dart`` module would run ``find_package(Dart)`` internally. Since :manual:`ctest(1)` was created, the ``Dart`` module has just been a compatibility shim that finds ``Dart`` to support some legacy functionality and then forwards to the :module:`CTest` module."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0145.rst:16
msgid "CMake 3.27 and above prefer to not provide the :module:`Dart` or :module:`FindDart` modules.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been ported away from them.  Projects using the ``Dart`` module should be updated to use the :module:`CTest` module directly."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0145.rst:21
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``include(Dart)`` and ``find_package(Dart)`` to load the deprecated modules.  The ``NEW`` behavior is for uses of the modules to fail as if they do not exist."
