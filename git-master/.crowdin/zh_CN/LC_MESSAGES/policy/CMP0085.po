msgid "In CMake 3.13 and lower, the ``$<IN_LIST:...>`` generator expression always returned ``0`` if the first argument was empty, even if the list contained an empty item. This behavior is inconsistent with the ``IN_LIST`` behavior of :command:`if`, which this generator expression is meant to emulate. CMake 3.14 and later handles this case correctly."
