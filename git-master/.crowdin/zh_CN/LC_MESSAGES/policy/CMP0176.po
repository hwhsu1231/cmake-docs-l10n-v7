msgid ":command:`execute_process` ``ENCODING`` is ``UTF-8`` by default."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0176.rst:8
msgid "The ``ENCODING`` option is meaningful only on Windows.  It specifies the character encoding expected in the process's output on stdout and stderr. In CMake 3.14 and below the default encoding was ``NONE``, which corresponds to CMake's internal UTF-8 encoding.  In CMake 3.15 through CMake 3.30 the default encoding was accidentally changed to ``AUTO``, but the change went unnoticed and was not documented."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0176.rst:15
msgid "CMake 3.31 and above prefer the ``ENCODING`` default to be ``UTF-8``. This policy provides compatibility with projects that may have been relying on the default being ``AUTO``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0176.rst:19
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for :command:`execute_process` to use ``AUTO`` by default if no ``ENCODING`` is specified.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use ``UTF-8`` as the default ``ENCODING``."
