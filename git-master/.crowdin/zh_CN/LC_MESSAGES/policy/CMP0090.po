msgid "In CMake 3.14 and below the :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command populated the user package registry by default and users needed to set the :variable:`CMAKE_EXPORT_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` to disable it, e.g. in automated build and packaging environments.  Since the user package registry is stored outside the build tree, this side effect should not be enabled by default. Therefore CMake 3.15 and above prefer that :command:`export(PACKAGE)` does nothing unless an explicit :variable:`CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` variable is set to enable it.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated."

The ``NEW`` behavior is for :command:`export(PACKAGE)` command to do nothing unless the :variable:`CMAKE_EXPORT_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` is enabled."
