msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed a signature for :command:`add_custom_command` which specified an input to a command.  This was undocumented behavior. Modern use of CMake associates custom commands with their output, rather than their input."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0050.rst:11
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow the use of :command:`add_custom_command` SOURCE signatures.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue an error if such a signature is used."

msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
