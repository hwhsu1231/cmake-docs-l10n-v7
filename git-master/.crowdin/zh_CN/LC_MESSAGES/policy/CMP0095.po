msgid "In CMake 3.15 and earlier, ``RPATH`` entries set via :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH` or via :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_RPATH` have not been escaped before being inserted into the ``cmake_install.cmake`` script. Dynamic linkers on ELF-based systems (e.g. Linux and FreeBSD) allow certain keywords in ``RPATH`` entries, such as ``${ORIGIN}`` (More details are available in the ``ld.so`` man pages on those systems). The syntax of these keywords can match CMake's variable syntax. In order to not be substituted (usually to an empty string) already by the intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script, the user had to double-escape such ``RPATH`` keywords, e.g. ``set(CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH \"\\\\\\${ORIGIN}/../lib\")``. Since the intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script is an implementation detail of CMake, CMake 3.16 and later will make sure ``RPATH`` entries are inserted literally by escaping any coincidental CMake syntax."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to not escape ``RPATH`` entries in the intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script. The ``NEW`` behavior is to properly escape coincidental CMake syntax in ``RPATH`` entries when generating the intermediary ``cmake_install.cmake`` script."
