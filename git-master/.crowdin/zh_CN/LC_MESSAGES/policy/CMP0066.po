msgid "Honor per-config flags in :command:`try_compile` source-file signature."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0066.rst:8
msgid "The source file signature of the :command:`try_compile` command uses the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variable in the test project so that the test compilation works as it would in the main project.  However, CMake 3.6 and below do not also honor config-specific compiler flags such as those in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG` variable.  CMake 3.7 and above prefer to honor config-specific compiler flags too.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that do not expect config-specific compiler flags to be used."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0066.rst:16
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to ignore config-specific flag variables like :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS_DEBUG` and only use CMake's built-in defaults for the current compiler and platform."
