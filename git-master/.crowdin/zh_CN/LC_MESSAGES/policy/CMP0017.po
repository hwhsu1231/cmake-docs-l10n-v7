#: ../../../policy/CMP0017.rst:6
msgid "Starting with CMake 2.8.4, if a cmake-module shipped with CMake (i.e. located in the CMake module directory) calls :command:`include` or :command:`find_package`, the files located in the CMake module directory are preferred over the files in :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`.  This makes sure that the modules belonging to CMake always get those files included which they expect, and against which they were developed and tested.  In all other cases, the files found in :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH` still take precedence over the ones in the CMake module directory.  The ``OLD`` behavior is to always prefer files from CMAKE_MODULE_PATH over files from the CMake modules directory."
