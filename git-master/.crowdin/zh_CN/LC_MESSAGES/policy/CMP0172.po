msgid "The :module:`CPack` module enables per-machine installation by default in the :cpack_gen:`CPack WIX Generator`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0172.rst:9
msgid "The :cpack_gen:`CPack WIX Generator`'s :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` option controls the scope of the generated Windows Installer package. When :variable:`CPACK_WIX_VERSION` is set to 4 or higher, the default scope is ``perMachine``.  However, when using WIX 3 the default scope is ``NONE``, and CPack does not set any ``InstallScope`` in the package specification. The resulting installer requires administrative privileges and installs into the system-wide ``ProgramFiles`` directory, but the start menu entry and uninstaller registration are created only for the current user."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0172.rst:18
msgid "The :module:`CPack` module in CMake 3.30 and older does not specify any :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` value by default, so CPack uses no installation scope by default with WIX 3.  CMake 3.31 and newer instead prefer to set :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` to ``perMachine`` by default to make the behavior consistent across all WIX versions.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect ``perMachine`` behavior."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to not set :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` by default.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to set :variable:`CPACK_WIX_INSTALL_SCOPE` to ``perMachine`` by default."
