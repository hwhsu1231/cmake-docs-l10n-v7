msgid "CMake 3.30 and earlier did not reserve ``codegen`` as a builtin target name, leaving projects free to create their own target with that name. CMake 3.31 and later prefer to reserve ``codegen`` as a builtin target name to drive custom commands created with the ``CODEGEN`` option to :command:`add_custom_command`.  In order to support building the ``codegen`` target in scripted environments, e.g., ``cmake --build . --target codegen``, the ``codegen`` target needs to be generated even if no custom commands use the ``CODEGEN`` option.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to avoid creating a target named ``codegen``."
