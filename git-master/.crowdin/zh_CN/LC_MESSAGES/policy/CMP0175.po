msgid "CMake 3.30 and earlier silently ignored unsupported keywords and missing or invalid arguments for the different forms of the :command:`add_custom_command` command. CMake 3.31 implements more rigorous argument checking and will flag invalid or missing arguments as errors."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0175.rst:13
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy will accept the same invalid keywords or arguments as CMake 3.30 and earlier. The ``NEW`` behavior will flag the following as errors that previously went unreported:"

msgid "When the ``APPEND`` keyword is given, the ``OUTPUT`` form also does not accept ``BYPRODUCTS``, ``COMMAND_EXPAND_LISTS``, ``DEPENDS_EXPLICIT_ONLY``, ``DEPFILE``, ``JOB_POOL``, ``JOB_SERVER_AWARE``, ``USES_TERMINAL``, or ``VERBATIM`` keywords."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0175.rst:23
msgid "The ``TARGET`` form requires exactly one of ``PRE_BUILD``, ``PRE_LINK``, or ``POST_BUILD`` to be given.  Previously, if none were given, ``POST_BUILD`` was assumed, or if multiple keywords were given, the last one was used."
