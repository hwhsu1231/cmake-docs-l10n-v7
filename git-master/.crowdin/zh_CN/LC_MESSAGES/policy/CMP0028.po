msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed the use of targets and files with double colons in :command:`target_link_libraries`, with some buildsystem generators."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0028.rst:9
msgid "The use of double-colons is a common pattern used to namespace ``IMPORTED`` targets and ``ALIAS`` targets.  When computing the link dependencies of a target, the name of each dependency could either be a target, or a file on disk.  Previously, if a target was not found with a matching name, the name was considered to refer to a file on disk.  This can lead to confusing error messages if there is a typo in what should be a target name."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to search for targets, then files on disk, even if the search term contains double-colons.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to issue a ``FATAL_ERROR`` if a link dependency contains double-colons but is not an ``IMPORTED`` target or an ``ALIAS`` target."
