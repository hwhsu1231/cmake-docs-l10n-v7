msgid "CMake 2.8.11 introduced introduced the concept of :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES`, and a check at cmake time that the entries in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of an ``IMPORTED`` target actually exist.  CMake 2.8.11 also introduced generator expression support in the :command:`target_link_libraries` command.  However, if an imported target is linked as a result of a generator expression evaluation, the entries in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of that target were not checked for existence as they should be."
