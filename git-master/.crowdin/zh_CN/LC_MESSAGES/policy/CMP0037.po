#: ../../../policy/CMP0037.rst:6
msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed creating targets using :command:`add_library`, :command:`add_executable` and :command:`add_custom_target` with unrestricted choice for the target name.  Newer cmake features such as :manual:`cmake-generator-expressions(7)` and some diagnostics expect target names to match a restricted pattern."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0037.rst:12
msgid "Target names may contain upper and lower case letters, numbers, the underscore character (``_``), dot(``.``), plus(``+``) and minus(``-``). As a special case, ``ALIAS`` and ``IMPORTED`` targets may contain two consecutive colons."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0037.rst:17
msgid "Target names reserved by one or more CMake generators are not allowed. Among others these include ``all``, ``clean``, ``help``, and ``install``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0037.rst:20
msgid "Target names associated with optional features, such as ``test`` and ``package``, may also be reserved.  CMake 3.10 and below always reserve them. CMake 3.11 and above reserve them only when the corresponding feature is enabled (e.g. by including the :module:`CTest` or :module:`CPack` modules)."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0037.rst:25
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to allow creating targets with reserved names or which do not match the validity pattern. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error if an add_* command is used with an invalid target name."

msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, and uses ``OLD`` behavior."

#: ../../../policy/DEPRECATED.txt:2
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
