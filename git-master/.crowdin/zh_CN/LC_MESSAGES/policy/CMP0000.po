msgid "CMake requires that projects specify the version of CMake to which they have been written.  This policy has been put in place so users trying to build the project may be told when they need to update their CMake.  Specifying a version also helps the project build with CMake versions newer than that specified.  Use the :command:`cmake_minimum_required` command at the top of your main ``CMakeLists.txt`` file:"

msgid "Note that the command invocation must appear in the ``CMakeLists.txt`` file itself; a call in an included file is not sufficient.  However, the  :command:`cmake_policy` command may be called to set policy ``CMP0000`` to ``OLD`` or ``NEW`` behavior explicitly.  The ``OLD`` behavior is to silently ignore the missing invocation.  The ``NEW`` behavior is to issue an error instead of a warning.  An included file may set ``CMP0000`` explicitly to affect how this policy is enforced for the main ``CMakeLists.txt`` file."
