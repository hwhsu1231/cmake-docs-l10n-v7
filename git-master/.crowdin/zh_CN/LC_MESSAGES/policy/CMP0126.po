msgid "When this policy is set to ``NEW``, the :command:`set(CACHE)` command does not remove any normal variable of the same name from the current scope. The ``OLD`` behavior removes any normal variable of the same name from the current scope in the following situations:"

#: ../../../policy/CMP0126.rst:13
msgid "A cache variable of that name existed previously, but it had no type. This can occur when the variable was set on the command line using a form like ``cmake -DMYVAR=blah`` instead of ``cmake -DMYVAR:STRING=blah``."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0126.rst:20
msgid "Note that the ``NEW`` behavior has an important difference to the similar ``NEW`` behavior of policy :policy:`CMP0077`.  The :command:`set(CACHE)` command always sets the cache variable if it did not exist previously, regardless of the ``CMP0126`` policy setting.  The :command:`option` command will *not* set the cache variable if a non-cache variable of the same name already exists and :policy:`CMP0077` is set to ``NEW``."
