msgid "This is a boolean option that, when set to ``TRUE``, will automatically run contents of variable :variable:`CMAKE_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_CHECK` on the target after it is linked. In addition, the linker flag specified by variable :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINK_WHAT_YOU_USE_FLAG`  will be passed to the target with the link command so that all libraries specified on the command line will be linked into the target. This will result in the link producing a list of libraries that provide no symbols used by this target but are being linked to it."
