msgid "On AIX, CMake automatically exports all symbols from shared libraries, and from executables with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property set. Explicitly disable this boolean property to suppress the behavior and export no symbols by default.  In this case it is expected that the project will use other means to export some symbols."
