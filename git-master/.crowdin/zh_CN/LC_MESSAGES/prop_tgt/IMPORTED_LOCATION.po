msgid "Set this to the location of an ``IMPORTED`` target file on disk.  For executables this is the location of the executable file.  For ``STATIC`` libraries and modules this is the location of the library or module. For ``SHARED`` libraries on non-DLL platforms this is the location of the shared library.  For application bundles on macOS this is the location of the executable file inside ``Contents/MacOS`` within the bundle folder. For frameworks on macOS this is the location of the library file symlink just inside the framework folder.  For DLLs this is the location of the ``.dll`` part of the library.  For ``UNKNOWN`` libraries this is the location of the file to be linked.  Ignored for non-imported targets."

msgid "For ordinary frameworks on Apple platforms, this may be the location of the ``.framework`` folder itself.  For XCFrameworks, it may be the location of the ``.xcframework`` folder, in which case any target that links against it will get the selected library's ``Headers`` directory as a usage requirement."

msgid "The ``IMPORTED_LOCATION`` target property may be overridden for a given configuration ``<CONFIG>`` by the configuration-specific :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>` target property.  Furthermore, the :prop_tgt:`MAP_IMPORTED_CONFIG_<CONFIG>` target property may be used to map between a project's configurations and those of an imported target.  If none of these is set then the name of any other configuration listed in the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_CONFIGURATIONS` target property may be selected and its :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION_<CONFIG>` value used."
