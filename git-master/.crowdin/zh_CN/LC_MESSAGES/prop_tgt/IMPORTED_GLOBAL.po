msgid "For targets created with the ``IMPORTED`` option to :command:`add_executable()` or :command:`add_library()` but without the additional option ``GLOBAL`` this is False, too. However, setting this property for such a locally ``IMPORTED`` target to True promotes that target to global scope. This promotion can only be done in the same directory where that ``IMPORTED`` target was created in the first place."

msgid "Once an imported target has been made global, it cannot be changed back to non-global. Therefore, if a project sets this property, it may only provide a value of True. CMake will issue an error if the project tries to set the property to a non-True value, even if the value was already False."
