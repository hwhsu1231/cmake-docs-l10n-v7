msgid "If unset or empty, rely on the compiler to determine whether the file should be preprocessed. If explicitly set to ``OFF`` then the file does not need to be preprocessed. If explicitly set to ``ON``, then the file does need to be preprocessed as part of the compilation step."

msgid "When using the :generator:`Ninja` generator, all source files are first preprocessed in order to generate module dependency information. Setting this property to ``OFF`` will make ``Ninja`` skip this step."

msgid "Use the source-specific :prop_sf:`Fortran_PREPROCESS` property if a single file needs to be preprocessed. If the variable :variable:`CMAKE_Fortran_PREPROCESS` is set when a target is created its value is used to initialize this property."
