msgid "When this global property is set to true, the :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES` variable is propagated into :command:`try_compile` calls that use the :ref:`whole-project signature <Try Compiling Whole Projects>`. Calls to the :ref:`source file signature <Try Compiling Source Files>` are not affected by this property. ``PROPAGATE_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES_TO_TRY_COMPILE`` is unset by default."

msgid "For :ref:`dependency providers <dependency_providers_overview>` that want to be enabled in whole-project :command:`try_compile` calls, set this global property to true just before or after registering the provider. Note that all files listed in :variable:`CMAKE_PROJECT_TOP_LEVEL_INCLUDES` will need to be able to handle being included in such :command:`try_compile` calls, and it is the user's responsibility to ensure this."
