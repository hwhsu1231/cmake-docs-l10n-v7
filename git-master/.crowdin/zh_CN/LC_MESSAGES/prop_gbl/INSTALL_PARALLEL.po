#: ../../../prop_gbl/INSTALL_PARALLEL.rst:18
msgid "When this property is ``ON``, ``cmake --install`` can be given the ``-j <jobs>`` or ``--parallel <jobs>`` option to specify a maximum number of jobs. The :envvar:`CMAKE_INSTALL_PARALLEL_LEVEL` environment variable specifies a default parallel level if this option is not provided."

#: ../../../prop_gbl/INSTALL_PARALLEL.rst:23
msgid "Calls to :command:`install(CODE)` or :command:`install(SCRIPT)` might depend on actions performed by an earlier :command:`install` command in a different directory such as files installed or variable settings. If the project has such order-dependent installation logic, parallel installation should be not be enabled, in order to prevent possible race conditions."
