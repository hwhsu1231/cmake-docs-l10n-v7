msgid "A property that can be set to indicate what programming language the source file is.  If it is not set the language is determined based on the file extension.  Typical values are ``CXX`` (i.e.  C++), ``C``, ``CSharp``, ``CUDA``, ``Fortran``, ``HIP``, ``ISPC``, and ``ASM``.  Setting this property for a file means this file will be compiled, unless :prop_sf:`HEADER_FILE_ONLY` is set."
