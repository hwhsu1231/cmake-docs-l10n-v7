msgid "The executable is run in the optionally specified directory.  The executable can include arguments if it is double quoted, but it is better to use the optional ``ARGS`` argument to specify arguments to the program.  This is because cmake will then be able to escape spaces in the executable path.  An optional argument ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` specifies a variable in which to store the output.  To capture the return value of the execution, provide a ``RETURN_VALUE``.  If ``OUTPUT_VARIABLE`` is specified, then no output will go to the stdout/stderr of the console running cmake."
