msgid "Enable this boolean property if a generated ``SHARED`` library should not have ``soname`` set.  Default is to set ``soname`` on all shared libraries as long as the platform supports it. Generally, use this property only for leaf private libraries or plugins.  If you use it on normal shared libraries which other targets link against, on some platforms a linker will insert a full path to the library (as specified at link time) into the dynamic section of the dependent binary.  Therefore, once installed, dynamic loader may eventually fail to locate the library for the binary."
