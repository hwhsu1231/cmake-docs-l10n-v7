msgid "When linking a shared library or executable that exports symbols using GNU tools on Windows (MinGW/MSYS) with Visual Studio installed convert the import library (``.dll.a``) from GNU to MS format (``.lib``).  Both import libraries will be installed by :command:`install(TARGETS)` and exported by :command:`install(EXPORT)` and  :command:`export` to be linked by applications with either GNU- or MS-compatible tools."

msgid "If the variable ``CMAKE_GNUtoMS`` is set when a target is created its value is used to initialize this property.  The variable must be set prior to the first command that enables a language such as :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language`.  CMake provides the variable as an option to the user automatically when configuring on Windows with GNU tools."
