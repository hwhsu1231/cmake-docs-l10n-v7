msgid "For IDEs that present targets using a folder hierarchy, this property specifies the name of the folder to place the target under. To nest folders, use ``FOLDER`` values such as ``GUI/Dialogs`` with ``/`` characters separating folder levels.  Targets with no ``FOLDER`` property will appear as top level entities.  Targets with the same ``FOLDER`` property value will appear in the same folder as siblings."
