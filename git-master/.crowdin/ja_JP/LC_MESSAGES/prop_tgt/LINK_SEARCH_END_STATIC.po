msgid "Some linkers support switches such as ``-Bstatic`` and ``-Bdynamic`` to determine whether to use static or shared libraries for ``-lXXX`` options. CMake uses these options to set the link type for libraries whose full paths are not known or (in some cases) are in implicit link directories for the platform.  By default CMake adds an option at the end of the library list (if necessary) to set the linker search type back to its starting type.  This property switches the final linker search type to ``-Bstatic`` regardless of how it started."
