msgid "One known use case for this identifier is to disambiguate the variables in an anonymous namespace in a limited scope. Anonymous namespaces present a problem for unity builds because they are used to ensure that certain variables and declarations are scoped to a translation unit which is approximated by a single source file.  When source files are combined in a unity build file, those variables in different files are combined in a single translation unit and the names clash.  This property can be used to avoid that with code like the following:"
