msgid "If set, this will tell the required compilers to enable device linking on the library target. Device linking is an additional link step required by some CUDA compilers when :prop_tgt:`CUDA_SEPARABLE_COMPILATION` is enabled. Normally device linking is deferred until a shared library or executable is generated, allowing for multiple static libraries to resolve device symbols at the same time when they are used by a shared library or executable."
