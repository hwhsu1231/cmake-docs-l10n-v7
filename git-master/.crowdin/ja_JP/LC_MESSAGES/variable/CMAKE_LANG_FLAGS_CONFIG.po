msgid "The flags in this variable will be passed after those in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_FLAGS` variable.  On invocations driving compiling, flags from both variables will be passed before flags added by commands such as :command:`add_compile_options` and :command:`target_compile_options`. On invocations driving linking, they will be passed before flags added by commands such as :command:`add_link_options` and :command:`target_link_options`."
