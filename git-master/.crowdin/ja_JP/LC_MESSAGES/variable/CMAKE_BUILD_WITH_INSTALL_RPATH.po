msgid "Normally CMake uses the build tree for the ``RPATH`` when building executables etc on systems that use ``RPATH``.  When the software is installed the executables etc are relinked by CMake to have the install ``RPATH``.  If this variable is set to true then the software is always built with the install path for the ``RPATH`` and does not need to be relinked when installed."
