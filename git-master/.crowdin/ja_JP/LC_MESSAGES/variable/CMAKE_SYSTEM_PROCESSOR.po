msgid "When not cross-compiling, this variable has the same value as the :variable:`CMAKE_HOST_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR` variable.  In many cases, this will correspond to the target architecture for the build, but this is not guaranteed.  (E.g. on Windows, the host may be ``AMD64`` even when using a MSVC ``cl`` compiler with a 32-bit target.)"

msgid "When cross-compiling, a :variable:`CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE` should set the ``CMAKE_SYSTEM_PROCESSOR`` variable to match target architecture that it specifies (via :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER` and perhaps :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_TARGET`)."
