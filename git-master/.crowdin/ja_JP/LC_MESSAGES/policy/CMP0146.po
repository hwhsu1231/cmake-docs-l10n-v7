msgid "The :module:`FindCUDA` module has been deprecated since CMake 3.10. CMake 3.27 and above prefer to not provide the module. This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been ported away from it."

msgid "Projects using the :module:`FindCUDA` module should be updated to use CMake's first-class ``CUDA`` language support.  List ``CUDA`` among the languages named in the top-level call to the :command:`project` command, or call the :command:`enable_language` command with ``CUDA``. Then one can add CUDA (``.cu``) sources directly to targets, similar to other languages."
