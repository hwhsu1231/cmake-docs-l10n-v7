msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed use of the :command:`include` command with the result of the :command:`export` command.  This relies on the assumption that the :command:`export` command has an immediate effect at configure-time during a cmake run.  Certain properties of targets are not fully determined until later at generate-time, such as the link language and complete list of link libraries.  Future refactoring will change the effect of the :command:`export` command to be executed at generate-time.  Use ``ALIAS`` targets instead in cases where the goal is to refer to targets by another name."
