msgid "The :module:`FindQt` module does not exist for :command:`find_package`."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0084.rst:8
msgid "The existence of :module:`FindQt` means that for Qt upstream to provide package config files that can be found by ``find_package(Qt)``, the consuming project has to explicitly specify ``find_package(Qt CONFIG)``. Removing this module gives Qt a path forward for exporting its own config files which can easily be found by consuming projects."

msgid "This policy pretends that CMake's internal :module:`FindQt` module does not exist for :command:`find_package`. If a project really wants to use Qt 3 or 4, it can call ``find_package(Qt[34])``, ``include(FindQt)``, or add :module:`FindQt` to their :variable:`CMAKE_MODULE_PATH`."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for :module:`FindQt` to exist for :command:`find_package`. The ``NEW`` behavior is to pretend that it doesn't exist for :command:`find_package`."
