msgid "CMake 3.29 and below provide a ``FindBoost`` module, but it needs constant updates to keep up with upstream Boost releases.  Upstream Boost 1.70 and above provide a ``BoostConfig.cmake`` package configuration file. ``find_package(Boost CONFIG)`` finds the upstream package directly, without the find module."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0167.rst:14
msgid "CMake 3.30 and above prefer to not provide the ``FindBoost`` module so that ``find_package(Boost)`` calls, without the ``CONFIG`` or ``NO_MODULE`` options, find the upstream ``BoostConfig.cmake`` directly. This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been ported to use the upstream Boost package."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0167.rst:20
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is for ``find_package(Boost)`` to load CMake's :module:`FindBoost` module.  The ``NEW`` behavior is for ``find_package(Boost)`` to search for the upstream ``BoostConfig.cmake``."
