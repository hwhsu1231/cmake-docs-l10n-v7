msgid "Compiler id for Apple Clang is now ``AppleClang``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0025.rst:6
msgid "CMake 3.0 and above recognize that Apple Clang is a different compiler than upstream Clang and that they have different version numbers. CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``AppleClang`` instead of ``Clang``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for Apple Clang is just ``Clang`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0. Therefore this policy determines for Apple Clang which compiler id to report in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  The policy must be set prior to the invocation of either command."
