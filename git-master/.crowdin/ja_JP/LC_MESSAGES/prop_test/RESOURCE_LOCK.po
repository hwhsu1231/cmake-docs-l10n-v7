msgid "Both the :prop_test:`RESOURCE_GROUPS` and ``RESOURCE_LOCK`` properties serve similar purposes, but they are distinct and orthogonal. Resources specified by :prop_test:`RESOURCE_GROUPS` do not affect ``RESOURCE_LOCK``, and vice versa. Whereas ``RESOURCE_LOCK`` is a simpler property that is used for locking one global resource, :prop_test:`RESOURCE_GROUPS` is a more advanced property that allows multiple tests to simultaneously use multiple resources of the same type, specifying their requirements in a fine-grained manner."
