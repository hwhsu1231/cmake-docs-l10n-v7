msgid "This is part of the ``Findosg*`` suite used to find OpenSceneGraph components.  Each component is separate and you must opt in to each module.  You must also opt into OpenGL and OpenThreads (and Producer if needed) as these modules won't do it for you.  This is to allow you control over your own system piece by piece in case you need to opt out of certain components or change the Find behavior for a particular module (perhaps because the default :module:`FindOpenGL` module doesn't work with your system as an example).  If you want to use a more convenient module that includes everything, use the :module:`FindOpenSceneGraph` instead of the ``Findosg*.cmake`` modules."
