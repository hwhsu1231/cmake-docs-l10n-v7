msgid "The command :command:`find_package` operates without an explicit mode when the reduced signature is used without the ``MODULE`` option. In this case, by default, CMake first tries Module mode by searching for a ``Find<pkg>.cmake`` module.  If it fails, CMake then searches for the package using Config mode."

msgid "This variable may be useful when a developer has compiled a custom version of a common library and wishes to link it to a dependent project.  If this variable is set to ``TRUE``, it would prevent a dependent project's call to :command:`find_package` from selecting the default library located by the system's ``Find<pkg>.cmake`` module before finding the developer's custom built library."

msgid "Once this variable is set, it is the responsibility of the exported ``<pkg>Config.cmake`` files to provide the same result variables as the ``Find<pkg>.cmake`` modules so that dependent projects can use them interchangeably."
