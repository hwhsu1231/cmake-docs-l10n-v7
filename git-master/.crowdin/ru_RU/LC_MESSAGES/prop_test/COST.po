msgid "This property describes the cost of a test.  When parallel testing is enabled, tests in the test set will be run in descending order of cost. Projects can explicitly define the cost of a test by setting this property to a floating point value."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../prop_test/COST.rst:9
msgid "When the cost of a test is not defined by the project, :manual:`ctest <ctest(1)>` will initially use a default cost of ``0``. It computes a weighted average of the cost each time a test is run and uses that as an improved estimate of the cost for the next run.  The more a test is re-run in the same build directory, the more representative the cost should become."
