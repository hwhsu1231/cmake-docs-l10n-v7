msgid "A :ref:`;-list <CMake Language Lists>` of files or directories that will be removed as a part of the global ``clean`` target.  It can be used to specify files and directories that are generated as part of building the target or that are directly associated with the target in some way (e.g. created as a result of running the target)."

#: ../../../prop_tgt/ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES.rst:12
msgid "For custom targets, if such files can be captured as outputs or byproducts instead, then that should be preferred over adding them to this property. If an additional clean file is used by multiple targets or isn't target-specific, then the :prop_dir:`ADDITIONAL_CLEAN_FILES` directory property may be the more appropriate property to use."
