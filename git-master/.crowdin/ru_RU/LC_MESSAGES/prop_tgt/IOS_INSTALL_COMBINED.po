msgid ":prop_tgt:`IOS_INSTALL_COMBINED` was designed to make universal binaries containing iOS/arm* device code paired with iOS Simulator/x86_64 code (or similar for other Apple embedded platforms). Universal binaries can only differentiate code based on CPU type, so this only made sense before the days of arm64 macOS machines (i.e. iOS Simulator/arm64). Apple now recommends xcframeworks, which contain multiple binaries for different platforms, for this use case."
