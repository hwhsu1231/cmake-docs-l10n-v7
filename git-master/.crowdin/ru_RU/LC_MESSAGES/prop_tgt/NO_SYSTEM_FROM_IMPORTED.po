msgid "When the consumed target's :prop_tgt:`SYSTEM` property is set to true, the contents of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property are treated as system includes or, on Apple platforms, when the target is a framework, it will be treated as system.  By default, :prop_tgt:`SYSTEM` is true for imported targets and false for other target types.  If the ``NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED`` property is set to true on a *consuming* target, compilation of sources in that consuming target will not treat the contents of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of consumed imported targets as system includes, even if that imported target's :prop_tgt:`SYSTEM` property is false."
