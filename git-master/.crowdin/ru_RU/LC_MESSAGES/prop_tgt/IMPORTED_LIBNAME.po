msgid "An interface library builds no library file itself but does specify usage requirements for its consumers.  The ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME`` property may be set to specify a single library name to be placed on the link line in place of the interface library target name as a requirement for using the interface."

#: ../../../prop_tgt/IMPORTED_LIBNAME.rst:15
msgid "This property is intended for use in naming libraries provided by a platform SDK for which the full path to a library file may not be known.  The value may be a plain library name such as ``foo`` but may *not* be a path (e.g. ``/usr/lib/libfoo.so``) or a flag (e.g. ``-Wl,...``).  The name is never treated as a library target name even if it happens to name one."

msgid "The ``IMPORTED_LIBNAME`` property is allowed only on :ref:`imported <Imported Targets>` :ref:`Interface Libraries` and is rejected on targets of other types (for which the :prop_tgt:`IMPORTED_LOCATION` target property may be used)."
