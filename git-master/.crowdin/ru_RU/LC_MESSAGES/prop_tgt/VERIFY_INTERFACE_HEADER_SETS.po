msgid "When this property is set to true, and the target is an object library, static library, shared library, interface library, or executable with exports enabled, and the target has one or more ``PUBLIC`` or ``INTERFACE`` header sets, an object library target named ``<target_name>_verify_interface_header_sets`` is created. This verification target has one source file per header in the ``PUBLIC`` and ``INTERFACE`` header sets. Each source file only includes its associated header file. The verification target links against the original target to get all of its usage requirements. The verification target has its :prop_tgt:`EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL` and :prop_tgt:`DISABLE_PRECOMPILE_HEADERS` properties set to true, and its :prop_tgt:`AUTOMOC`, :prop_tgt:`AUTORCC`, :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC`, and :prop_tgt:`UNITY_BUILD` properties set to false."

Otherwise, if the target has any C++ sources, the header is compiled as C++. Otherwise, if the target has any C sources, the header is compiled as C. Otherwise, if C++ is enabled globally, the header is compiled as C++. Otherwise, if C is enabled globally, the header is compiled as C. Otherwise, the header file is not compiled."
