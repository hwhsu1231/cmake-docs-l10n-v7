msgid "``AUTOUIC_EXECUTABLE`` is file path pointing to the ``uic`` executable to use for :prop_tgt:`AUTOUIC` enabled files. Setting this property will make CMake skip the automatic detection of the ``uic`` binary as well as the sanity-tests normally run to ensure that the binary is available and working as expected."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../prop_tgt/AUTOUIC_EXECUTABLE.rst:12
msgid "Usually this property does not need to be set. Only consider this property if auto-detection of ``uic`` can not work -- e.g. because you are building the ``uic`` binary as part of your project."
