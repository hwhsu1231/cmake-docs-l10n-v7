msgid "``INSTALL_NAME_DIR`` is a string specifying the directory portion of the \"install_name\" field of shared libraries on Apple platforms for installed targets.  When not set, the default directory used is determined by :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_RPATH`.  If the :prop_tgt:`BUILD_WITH_INSTALL_NAME_DIR` property is set, this will be used already in the build tree. Policies :policy:`CMP0068` and :policy:`CMP0042` are also relevant."
