msgid "When this property is set to ``TRUE``, the directory portion of the ``install_name`` field of this shared library will be ``@rpath`` unless overridden by :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR`.  This indicates the shared library is to be found at runtime using runtime paths (rpaths)."

msgid "Policy :policy:`CMP0042` was introduced to change the default value of ``MACOSX_RPATH`` to ``TRUE``.  This is because use of ``@rpath`` is a more flexible and powerful alternative to ``@executable_path`` and ``@loader_path``."
