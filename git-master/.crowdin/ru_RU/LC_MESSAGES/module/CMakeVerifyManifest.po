msgid "This script is used to verify that embedded manifests and side by side manifests for a project match.  To run this script, cd to a directory and run the script with cmake -P.  On the command line you can pass in versions that are OK even if not found in the .manifest files.  For example, cmake -Dallow_versions=8.0.50608.0 -PCmakeVerifyManifest.cmake could be used to allow an embedded manifest of 8.0.50608.0 to be used in a project even if that version was not found in the .manifest file."
