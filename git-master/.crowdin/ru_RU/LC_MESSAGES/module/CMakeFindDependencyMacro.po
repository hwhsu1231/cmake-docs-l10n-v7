msgid "It is designed to be used in a :ref:`Package Configuration File <Config File Packages>` (``<PackageName>Config.cmake``).  ``find_dependency`` forwards the correct parameters for ``QUIET`` and ``REQUIRED`` which were passed to the original :command:`find_package` call.  Any additional arguments specified are forwarded to :command:`find_package`."

#: ../../../../Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:35
msgid "If ``find_dependency`` is called with arguments identical to a previous call in the same directory, perhaps due to diamond-shaped package dependencies, the underlying call to :command:`find_package` is optimized out.  This optimization is important to support large package dependency graphs while avoiding a combinatorial explosion of repeated searches. However, the heuristic cannot account for ambient variables that affect package behavior, such as ``<PackageName>_USE_STATIC_LIBS``, offered by some packages.  Therefore package configuration files should avoid setting such variables before their calls to ``find_dependency``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../../Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:45
msgid "Previously, the underlying call to :command:`find_package` was always optimized out if the package had already been found.  CMake 3.15 removed the optimization to support cases in which ``find_dependency`` call arguments request different components."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../../Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:51
msgid "The pre-3.15 optimization was restored, but with the above-described heuristic to account for varying ``find_dependency`` call arguments."
