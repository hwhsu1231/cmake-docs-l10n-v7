msgid "Compiler id for IBM Clang-based XL compilers is now ``XLClang``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0089.rst:8
msgid "CMake 3.15 and above recognize that IBM's Clang-based XL compilers that define ``__ibmxl__`` are a new front-end distinct from ``xlc`` with a different command line and set of capabilities. CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``XLClang`` instead of ``XL``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for Clang-based XL is just ``XL`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.15. Therefore this policy determines for Clang-based XL compilers which compiler id to report in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  The policy must be set prior to the invocation of either command."
