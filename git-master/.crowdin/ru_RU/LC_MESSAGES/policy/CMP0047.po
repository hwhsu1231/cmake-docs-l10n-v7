#: ../../../policy/CMP0047.rst:6
msgid "CMake 3.0 and above recognize that the QNX qcc compiler driver is different from the GNU compiler. CMake now prefers to present this to projects by setting the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable to ``QCC`` instead of ``GNU``.  However, existing projects may assume the compiler id for QNX qcc is just ``GNU`` as it was in CMake versions prior to 3.0. Therefore this policy determines for QNX qcc which compiler id to report in the :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID` variable after language ``<LANG>`` is enabled by the :command:`project` or :command:`enable_language` command.  The policy must be set prior to the invocation of either command."
