msgid "CMake 2.8.10 and lower re-evaluated values given to the include_directories, link_directories, and link_libraries commands to expand any leftover variable references at the end of the configuration step.  This was for strict compatibility with VERY early CMake versions because all variable references are now normally evaluated during CMake language processing.  CMake 2.8.11 and higher prefer to skip the extra evaluation."
