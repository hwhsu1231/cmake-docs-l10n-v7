msgid "In CMake 3.24 and below, the :generator:`Xcode` generator preceded each entry of a library search path with a copy of itself appended with ``$(CONFIGURATION)$(EFFECTIVE_PLATFORM_NAME)``.  This was left from very early versions of CMake in which per-config directories were not well modeled.  Such paths often do not exist, resulting in warnings from the toolchain.  CMake 3.25 and above prefer to not add such library search paths.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that may have been accidentally relying on the old behavior."
