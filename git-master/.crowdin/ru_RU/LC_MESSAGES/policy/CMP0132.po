msgid "Apart from when using the Xcode generator and some Visual Studio generators, CMake 3.23 and below will set environment variables like :envvar:`CC`, :envvar:`CXX`, etc. when the corresponding language is enabled. This only occurs on the very first time CMake is run in a build directory, and the environment variables are only defined at configure time, not build time. On subsequent CMake runs, these environment variables are not set, opening up the opportunity for different behavior between the first and subsequent CMake runs. CMake 3.24 and above prefer to not set these environment variables when a language is enabled, even on the first run in a build directory."
