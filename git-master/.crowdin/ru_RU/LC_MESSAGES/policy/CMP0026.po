#: ../../../policy/CMP0026.rst:6
msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and lower allowed reading the :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` target property (and configuration-specific variants) to determine the eventual location of build targets.  This relies on the assumption that all necessary information is available at configure-time to determine the final location and filename of the target.  However, this property is not fully determined until later at generate-time.  At generate time, the :genex:`$<TARGET_FILE>` generator expression can be used to determine the eventual :prop_tgt:`LOCATION` of a target output."
