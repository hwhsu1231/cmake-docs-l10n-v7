msgid "In CMake 2.6.2 and below, CMake Policy settings in scripts loaded by the :command:`include` and :command:`find_package` commands would affect the includer.  Explicit invocations of ``cmake_policy(PUSH)`` and ``cmake_policy(POP)`` were required to isolate policy changes and protect the includer.  While some scripts intend to affect the policies of their includer, most do not.  In CMake 2.6.3 and above, :command:`include` and :command:`find_package` by default ``PUSH`` and ``POP`` an entry on the policy stack around an included script, but provide a ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` option to disable it.  This policy determines whether or not to imply ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` for compatibility.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to imply ``NO_POLICY_SCOPE`` for :command:`include` and :command:`find_package` commands. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to allow the commands to do their default cmake_policy ``PUSH`` and ``POP``."
