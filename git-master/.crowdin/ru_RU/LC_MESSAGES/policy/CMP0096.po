msgid "When a ``VERSION <major>[.<minor>[.<patch>[.<tweak>]]]]`` argument is given to the :command:`project` command, it stores the version string in the ``PROJECT_VERSION`` variable and stores individual integer version components in ``PROJECT_VERSION_{MAJOR,MINOR,PATCH,TWEAK}`` variables (see policy :policy:`CMP0048`).  CMake 3.15 and below dropped leading zeros from each component.  CMake 3.16 and higher prefer to preserve leading zeros.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the new behavior."
