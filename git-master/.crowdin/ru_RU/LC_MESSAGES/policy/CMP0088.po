msgid ":module:`FindBISON` runs bison in :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` when executing."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0088.rst:9
msgid "The module provides a ``BISON_TARGET`` macro which generates BISON output. In CMake 3.13 and below the macro would generate a custom command that runs ``bison`` in the source directory.  CMake 3.14 and later prefer to run it in the build directory and use :variable:`CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR` as the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` of its :command:`add_custom_command` invocation. This ensures that any implicitly generated file is written to the build tree rather than the source."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``BISON_TARGET`` to use the current source directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and where to generate implicit files. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to use the current binary directory for the ``WORKING_DIRECTORY`` and where to generate implicit files."
