msgid "CMake 3.27 and below assume that C++ sources do not ``import`` modules. CMake 3.28 and above prefer to assume that C++ sources in targets using C++20 or higher might ``import`` modules, and must be scanned before compiling, unless explicitly disabled.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that use C++20 or higher, without modules, that have not been updated to turn off scanning, e.g., via the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` variable. See the :manual:`cmake-cxxmodules(7)` manual for more details on C++ module support."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to assume that C++ 20 and newer sources do not import modules.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to assume that C++ 20 and newer files may import modules if the compiler understands how to scan for their dependencies, and need to be scanned."
