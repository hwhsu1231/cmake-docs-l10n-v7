msgid "CMake 2.8.12 and newer has support for using ``@rpath`` in a target's install name.  This was enabled by setting the target property :prop_tgt:`MACOSX_RPATH`.  The ``@rpath`` in an install name is a more flexible and powerful mechanism than ``@executable_path`` or ``@loader_path`` for locating shared libraries."

#: ../../../policy/CMP0042.rst:12
msgid "CMake 3.0 and later prefer this property to be ON by default.  Projects wanting ``@rpath`` in a target's install name may remove any setting of the :prop_tgt:`INSTALL_NAME_DIR` and :variable:`CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR` variables."
