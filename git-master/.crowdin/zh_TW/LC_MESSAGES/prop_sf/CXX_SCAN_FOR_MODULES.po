msgid "When this property is set ``ON``, CMake will scan the source at build time and add module dependency information to the compile line as necessary.  When this property is set ``OFF``, CMake will not scan the source at build time.  When this property is unset, the :prop_tgt:`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` property is consulted."
