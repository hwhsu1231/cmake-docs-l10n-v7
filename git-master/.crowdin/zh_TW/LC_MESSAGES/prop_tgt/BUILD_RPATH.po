msgid "A :ref:`semicolon-separated list <CMake Language Lists>` specifying runtime path (``RPATH``) entries to add to binaries linked in the build tree (for platforms that support it).  By default, CMake sets the runtime path of binaries in the build tree to contain search paths it knows are needed to find the shared libraries they link. Projects may set ``BUILD_RPATH`` to specify additional search paths."
