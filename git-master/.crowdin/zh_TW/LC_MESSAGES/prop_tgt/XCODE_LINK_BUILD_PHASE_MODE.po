msgid "When using the :generator:`Xcode` generator, libraries to be linked will be specified in the Xcode project file using either the \"Link Binary With Libraries\" build phase or directly as linker flags.  The former allows Xcode to manage build paths, which may be necessary when creating Xcode archives because it may use different build paths to a regular build."
