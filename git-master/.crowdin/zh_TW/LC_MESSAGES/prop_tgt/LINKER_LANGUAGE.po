msgid "For executables, shared libraries, and modules, this sets the language whose compiler is used to link the target (such as \"C\" or \"CXX\").  A typical value for an executable is the language of the source file providing the program entry point (main).  If not set, the language with the highest linker preference value is the default.  Details of the linker preferences are considered internal, but some limited discussion can be found under the internal :variable:`CMAKE_<LANG>_LINKER_PREFERENCE` variables."
