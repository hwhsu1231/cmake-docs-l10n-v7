msgid "``CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES`` is a boolean specifying whether CMake will scan C++ sources in the target for module dependencies.  See also the :prop_sf:`CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` for per-source settings which, if set, overrides the target-wide settings."

msgid "This property is initialized by the value of the :variable:`CMAKE_CXX_SCAN_FOR_MODULES` variable if it is set when a target is created."

msgid "When this property is set ``ON`` or unset, CMake will scan the target's ``CXX`` sources at build time and add module dependency information to the compile line as necessary.  When this property is set ``OFF``, CMake will not scan the target's ``CXX`` sources at build time."
