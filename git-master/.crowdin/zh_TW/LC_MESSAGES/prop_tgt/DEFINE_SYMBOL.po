msgid "``DEFINE_SYMBOL`` sets the name of the preprocessor symbol defined when compiling sources in a shared library.  If not set here then it is set to ``target_EXPORTS`` by default (with some substitutions if the target is not a valid C identifier).  This is useful for headers to know whether they are being included from inside their library or outside to properly setup dllexport/dllimport decorations on Windows."
