msgid "Do not treat include directories from the interfaces of consumed :ref:`imported targets` as system directories."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../prop_tgt/NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED.rst:7
msgid "When the consumed target's :prop_tgt:`SYSTEM` property is set to true, the contents of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` target property are treated as system includes or, on Apple platforms, when the target is a framework, it will be treated as system.  By default, :prop_tgt:`SYSTEM` is true for imported targets and false for other target types.  If the ``NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED`` property is set to true on a *consuming* target, compilation of sources in that consuming target will not treat the contents of the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` of consumed imported targets as system includes, even if that imported target's :prop_tgt:`SYSTEM` property is false."

msgid "Directories listed in the :prop_tgt:`INTERFACE_SYSTEM_INCLUDE_DIRECTORIES` property of consumed targets are not affected by ``NO_SYSTEM_FROM_IMPORTED``. Those directories will always be treated as system include directories by consumers."

msgid "See the :prop_tgt:`EXPORT_NO_SYSTEM` target property to set this behavior on the target providing the include directories rather than the target consuming them."
