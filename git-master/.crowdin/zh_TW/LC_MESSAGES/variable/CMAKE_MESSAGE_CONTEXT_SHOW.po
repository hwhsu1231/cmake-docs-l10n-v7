msgid "This variable is an alternative to providing the ``--log-context`` option on the :manual:`cmake <cmake(1)>` command line.  Whereas the command line option will apply only to that one CMake run, setting ``CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW`` to true as a cache variable will ensure that subsequent CMake runs will continue to show the message context."

msgid "Projects should not set ``CMAKE_MESSAGE_CONTEXT_SHOW``.  It is intended for users so that they may control whether or not to include context with messages."
