msgid "By default this variable is not set and the behavior will fall back to that determined by the deprecated :variable:`CMAKE_FIND_PACKAGE_NO_PACKAGE_REGISTRY` variable.  If that is also not set, then :command:`find_package` will use the :ref:`User Package Registry` unless the ``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` option is provided."

msgid "In some cases, for example to locate only system wide installations, it is not desirable to use the :ref:`User Package Registry` when searching for packages.  If the ``CMAKE_FIND_USE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` variable is ``FALSE``, all the :command:`find_package` commands will skip the :ref:`User Package Registry` as if they were called with the ``NO_CMAKE_PACKAGE_REGISTRY`` argument."
