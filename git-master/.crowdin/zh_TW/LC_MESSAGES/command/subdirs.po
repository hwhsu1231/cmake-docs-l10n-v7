msgid "Add a list of subdirectories to the build.  The :command:`add_subdirectory` command should be used instead of ``subdirs`` although ``subdirs`` will still work.  This will cause any CMakeLists.txt files in the sub directories to be processed by CMake.  Any directories after the ``PREORDER`` flag are traversed first by makefile builds, the ``PREORDER`` flag has no effect on IDE projects.  Any directories after the ``EXCLUDE_FROM_ALL`` marker will not be included in the top level makefile or project file.  This is useful for having CMake create makefiles or projects for a set of examples in a project.  You would want CMake to generate makefiles or project files for all the examples at the same time, but you would not want them to show up in the top level project or be built each time make is run from the top."
