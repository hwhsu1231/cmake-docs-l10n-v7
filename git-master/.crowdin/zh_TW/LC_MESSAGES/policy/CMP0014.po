msgid "CMake versions before 2.8 silently ignored missing ``CMakeLists.txt`` files in directories referenced by :command:`add_subdirectory` or  :command:`subdirs`, treating them as if present but empty.  In CMake 2.8.0 and above this :command:`cmake_policy` determines whether or not the case is an error. The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to silently ignore the problem. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to report an error."
