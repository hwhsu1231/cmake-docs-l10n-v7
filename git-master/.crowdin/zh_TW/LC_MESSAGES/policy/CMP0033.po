msgid "This command was added in January 2003 to export ``<tgt>_LIB_DEPENDS`` internal CMake cache entries to a file for installation with a project. This was used at the time to allow transitive link dependencies to work for applications outside of the original build tree of a project. The functionality has been superseded by the :command:`export` and :command:`install(EXPORT)` commands."
