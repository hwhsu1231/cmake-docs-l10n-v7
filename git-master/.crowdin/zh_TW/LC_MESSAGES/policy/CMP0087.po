msgid "Note that it is the value of this policy setting at the end of the directory scope that is important, not its setting at the time of the call to :command:`install(CODE)` or :command:`install(SCRIPT)`.  This has implications for calling these commands from places that have their own policy scope but not their own directory scope (e.g. from files brought in via :command:`include()` rather than :command:`add_subdirectory()`)."
