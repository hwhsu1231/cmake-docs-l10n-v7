msgid "The logical name of executable and library targets does not have to correspond to the physical file names built.  Consider using the :prop_tgt:`OUTPUT_NAME` target property to create two targets with the same physical name while keeping logical names distinct.  Custom targets must simply have globally unique names (unless one uses the global property :prop_gbl:`ALLOW_DUPLICATE_CUSTOM_TARGETS` with a Makefiles generator)."
