#: ../../../policy/CMP0018.rst:6
msgid "CMake 2.8.8 and lower compiled sources in ``SHARED`` and ``MODULE`` libraries using the value of the undocumented ``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` platform variable.  The variable contained platform-specific flags needed to compile objects for shared libraries.  Typically it included a flag such as ``-fPIC`` for position independent code but also included other flags needed on certain platforms.  CMake 2.8.9 and higher prefer instead to use the :prop_tgt:`POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE` target property to determine what targets should be position independent, and new undocumented platform variables to select flags while ignoring ``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` completely."

msgid "The default for either approach produces identical compilation flags, but if a project modifies ``CMAKE_SHARED_LIBRARY_<Lang>_FLAGS`` from its original value this policy determines which approach to use."
