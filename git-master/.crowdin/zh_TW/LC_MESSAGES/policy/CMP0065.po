#: ../../../policy/CMP0065.rst:9
msgid "CMake 3.3 and below, for historical reasons, always linked executables on some platforms with flags like ``-rdynamic`` to export symbols from the executables for use by any plugins they may load via ``dlopen``. CMake 3.4 and above prefer to do this only for executables that are explicitly marked with the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to always use the additional link flags when linking executables regardless of the value of the :prop_tgt:`ENABLE_EXPORTS` target property."
