msgid ":module:`BundleUtilities` cannot be included at configure time."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0080.rst:8
msgid "The macros provided by :module:`BundleUtilities` are intended to be invoked at install time rather than at configure time, because they depend on the listed targets already existing at the time they are invoked. If they are invoked at configure time, the targets haven't been built yet, and the commands will fail."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0080.rst:14
msgid "This policy restricts the inclusion of :module:`BundleUtilities` to ``cmake -P`` style scripts and install rules. Specifically, it looks for the presence of :variable:`CMAKE_GENERATOR` and throws a fatal error if it exists."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0080.rst:18
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of this policy is to allow :module:`BundleUtilities` to be included at configure time. The ``NEW`` behavior of this policy is to disallow such inclusion."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/STANDARD_ADVICE.txt:1
msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, and uses ``OLD`` behavior."

#: ../../../policy/DEPRECATED.txt:2
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
