msgid "This policy determines whether the list command will ignore empty elements in the list.  CMake 2.4 and below list commands ignored all empty elements in the list.  For example, ``a;b;;c`` would have length 3 and not 4.  The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to ignore empty list elements.  The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to correctly count empty elements in a list."
