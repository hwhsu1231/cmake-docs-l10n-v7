msgid ":command:`ExternalProject_Add` with ``GIT_SUBMODULES \"\"`` initializes no submodules."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0097.rst:9
msgid "The commands provide a ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` option which controls what submodules to initialize and update. Starting with CMake 3.16, explicitly setting ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` to an empty string means no submodules will be initialized or updated."

msgid "This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the new behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0097.rst:17
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to an empty string to initialize and update all git submodules. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is for ``GIT_SUBMODULES`` when set to an empty string to initialize and update no git submodules."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/STANDARD_ADVICE.txt:1
msgid "This policy was introduced in CMake version |INTRODUCED_IN_CMAKE_VERSION|. It may be set by :command:`cmake_policy` or :command:`cmake_minimum_required`. If it is not set, CMake |WARNS_OR_DOES_NOT_WARN|, and uses ``OLD`` behavior."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0097.rst:28
msgid "This policy also applies to :command:`FetchContent_Declare`, which uses the same download and update features as :command:`ExternalProject_Add`.  However, due to an implementation deficiency present since the policy was first introduced, CMake 3.16 and later always uses the ``NEW`` behavior for :command:`FetchContent_Declare`, regardless of the policy setting. Formally, this forcing of ``NEW`` behavior for :command:`FetchContent_Declare` will continue to apply in future CMake releases."

#: ../../../policy/DEPRECATED.txt:2
msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior of a policy is :manual:`deprecated by definition <cmake-policies(7)>` and may be removed in a future version of CMake."
