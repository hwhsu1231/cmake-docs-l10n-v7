msgid "In CMake 3.18 and below, the :command:`find_program` command on UNIX would find files that are readable without requiring execute permission, and would not find files that are executable without read permission. In CMake 3.19 and above, ``find_program`` now prefers to require execute permission but not read permission.  This policy provides compatibility with projects that have not been updated to expect the new behavior."
