msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0161.rst:8
msgid "Before CMake 3.29, the :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS` variable is unset by default.  When using the :cpack_gen:`CPack productbuild Generator`, this disables the use of the ``domains`` attribute in the productbuild Distribution XML, and falls back to the ``auth`` attribute instead. These attributes control where a productbuild package is allowed to be installed.  But the ``auth`` attribute has been deprecated by Apple, so projects should migrate to using ``domains`` instead."
msgstr ""

#: ../../../policy/CMP0161.rst:16
msgid "CMake 3.29 and above prefer to use a default value of true for :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS`, which means ``domains`` will be used by default unless the project explicitly sets :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS` to false. This policy provides compatibility with projects that enabled the :cpack_gen:`CPack productbuild Generator`, but did not explicitly set :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS`."

msgid "The ``OLD`` behavior for this policy is to leave :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS` unset if it hasn't been set. The ``NEW`` behavior for this policy is to use a default value of true for :variable:`CPACK_PRODUCTBUILD_DOMAINS`."
