msgid "CMake 3.13 and lower ran the install rules from :command:`add_subdirectory` after all other install rules, even if :command:`add_subdirectory` was called before the other install rules.  CMake 3.14 and above prefer to interleave these :command:`add_subdirectory` install rules with the others so that they are run in the order they are declared.  This policy provides compatibility for projects that have not been updated to expect the new behavior."
